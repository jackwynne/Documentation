# What is Power BI?

Power BI is a reporting and analytics platform which allows users to connect to a wide range of data sources to create and publish interactive reports and dashboards.

There are 2 key versions of Power BI that we use:
- Power BI Desktop
- Power BI Service (Pro and Premium)

### Power BI Desktop:

A **free** desktop application which provides advanced data explorations, transformation, modelling, and report generation with highly interactive visualisations. You can save your work as a .PBIX file on your local machine, and publish your data and reports to Power BI service to share with other members within your organisations.

### Power BI Service: 

- Pay per license (Pro) or amount of space and processing capacity (Premium). 
- Intended of large enterprise-level businesses.

Essentially gives users the ability to share data, reports, and dashboard with others within the organisation.
